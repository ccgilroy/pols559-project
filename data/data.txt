This directory contains the plain text content for the Wikipedia
entries linked from Wikipedia's list of gay, lesbian or bisexual individuals.

It contains 2883 unique wikipedia pages for 2897 table listings.
(In additions, there was one listing that had a link to a nonexistent page,
and three that did not have links to pages.

The text files do not include images, links, or tables. They include
simple markup for section headers.

They were obtained using the `wikipedia` Python package, which is a
simple package for parsing data from Wikipedia.

In addition, `lgb_table.csv` contains the table metadata (name,
page title, lifetime, nationality, reason for notability, and label
as L, G, or B). `lgb_pages.csv` contains page title, page id, url, summary,
and full content for each page (so, the last column replicates the txt/ folder,
where the link between them is the numeric page id).

(I plan to include entries from the separate list of transgender individuals,
but the data structure for that page is in a different form that needs
separate scripts.)
